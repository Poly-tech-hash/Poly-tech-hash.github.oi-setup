                  Technology field. I have obtained a Higher Certificate in IT from Richfield
                  Graduate Institute of Technology and Currently pursued Bachelor's degree

                   who is self-motivated with strong work ethics, have good interpersonal skills
                   and the ability to analyse and solve problems.I have a technical experience of
                    using Visual Basic,Java Script,Microsoft word,CSS,Microsoft PowerPoint and
                     Microsoft Excel.Aside from my certificate, I have built upon my eagerness to
                      learn more in this field in a numbser of ways. I am confident that i can bring
